## What was the best part for me?

The best part of this project is building this in NextJS. It's always fun :)

## What was the hardest part for me and how handled it?

The hardest part for me was to come with any design. It was hard as I don't have any figma designs, and I don't have the time to build those designs. So that was bit challenging. However, I found inspirations from dribble and similar kind of websites and tried different designs directly and came up with this.
